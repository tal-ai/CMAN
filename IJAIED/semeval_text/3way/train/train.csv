Explain to Betty why this happens.,In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.,It happens because the earth is rotating and it does not stay on the same place every time of day.,2
4685,Betty was puzzled. In the morning the shadow of the bus sign is in the street. In the afternoon the shadow of the bus sign points the opposite direction. Explain to Betty why this happens.,In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.,That happened because the earth moves which made the sun face the other way and made the sign face the other direction.,2
4686,Betty was puzzled. In the morning the shadow of the bus sign is in the street. In the afternoon the shadow of the bus sign points the opposite direction. Explain to Betty why this happens.,In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.,Because the sun rises in the east and sets on the west.

5188,"Cory and Rachael set up 3 solar water heaters to see which would show the greatest water temperature change. The containers are shown below. Each is the same height (4 centimeters), and the same width (10 centimeters). Only the lengths are different; Container A is 10 centimeters, Container B is 30 centimeters, and Container C is 40 centimeters. They painted the plastic containers black, filled each with the same amount of water, and put a clear plastic lid on each one. Then they set them out in the sunshine. Here are the data that Cory and Rachael collected: After 10 minutes Container A was 3 degrees Celsius, Container B was 9 degrees Celsius, and Container C was 12 degrees Celsius.

6111,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The motor shall not run because electricity flows out of the negative side of the battery.,2
6112,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The motors will not run because the D-cells has to be switched around.,2
6113,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",They will not run because the electricity gets stopped when it goes through the D-cells.,2
6114,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The motors shown at the right will not run because 2 negatives are connected.,1
6115,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The wires are not supposed to be connected like that.,2
6116,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because you need more wires.,2
6117,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because the motors do not have a minus side. They both have a positive side.,3
6118,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The motor at the right will not run because each one does not have a positive and a negative.,2
6119,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because positive is facing it.,2
6120,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Maybe the left wire went out of energy so maybe the right one went out of energy so both of them are out.,2
6121,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",If you look very closely the positive to positive and negative to negative. Positive and positive do not go together.,2
6122,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",It will not work because it is dead battery.,2
6123,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because one has the most power than the other one.,2
6124,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because one D-cell has to be between the motors.,2

6127,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The D-cell is hooked up to the negative end and the other negative end and it cannot get any energy.,1
6128,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The negative end is pointing at the negative end so no electricity can flow to the motors.,1
6129,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",The negative end are sharing so the D-cell is getting all the power.,2
6130,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.",Because electricity does not flow from positive to positive they flow from negative to positive.,1
6131,The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.,"The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.","The electricity is flowing from a positive to a positive end, when the negative should give the electricity to the motor and back to a positive end.",1

The number of drops they added to make a 10 milliliter sample of the blue indophenol indicator become colorless are given here: 8 drops of Overly Orange 13 drops of Luscious Lemon 33 drops of Fruitsnap (and it still didn't change color). Does Overly Orange or Luscious Lemon contain a higher concentration of vitamin C? What is the evidence?,Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.,It took less juice to make the indophenol turn clear.,0
